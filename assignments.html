        <p>This assignment focused on collecting and analyzing elevator arrival data to determine the optimal location to wait in the CDS lobby, minimizing the expected walking distance to the next arriving elevator. I implemented solutions by calculating the average inter-arrival times of the elevators, determining probabilities based on these times, and using weighted averages to identify the best waiting position.</p>

        <h3>Assignment 3: SVD Preprocessing on MNIST with Logistic Regression</h3>
        <p>This assignment focuses on applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a preprocessing step to the MNIST dataset, reducing its dimensionality for efficient logistic regression classification. A custom SVD algorithm was implemented, followed by training a logistic regression model on both the original and SVD-reduced data to compare accuracy and training time. The assignment also includes visualizing the top singular vectors and analyzing the trade-offs between dimensionality reduction, performance, and training efficiency.</p>

    <!-- Assignment 4: LSA -->
    <div class="assignment">
        <h3>Assignment 4: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Search Engine Webpage</h3>
        <p>This project implements an interactive Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) search engine designed to retrieve and rank documents based on their similarity to a user’s query. The project utilizes the 20 Newsgroups dataset, a popular corpus for text mining and natural language processing tasks, and follows a structured approach to dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The core functionality involves transforming documents into a term-document matrix using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to capture the importance of words in documents. Then, LSA is applied through SVD to reduce the dimensionality of the document space, allowing for more efficient query matching. When a user submits a query, it is transformed and projected into the same reduced space. The search engine computes cosine similarity between the query and all documents, returning the top 5 most relevant documents ranked by similarity. Results are displayed on a webpage, complete with document metadata and a bar chart visualization of the similarity scores. The project is built with Flask for the web application and Plotly for dynamic chart visualization, and is fully integrated with a GitHub Actions workflow to ensure consistent and reliable builds.</p>

This model leverages engineered features like review sentiment and mean movie rating, with hyperparameter tuning and SMOTE oversampling to address imbalances. I achieved high accuracy in predicting 5-star reviews, while focusing on improving performance for the challenging middle-range ratings. Dimensionality reduction and optimized weighting schemes helped balance the model’s sensitivity across all star ratings.</p>

The work involved generating datasets with varying levels of separation between clusters, fitting a logistic regression model, and analyzing changes in parameters like slope, intercept ratio, and logistic loss as the separation increased. Visualizations included the decision boundary, confidence intervals, and parameter trends, providing insights into how logistic regression adapts to data changes.</p>

    <div class="assignment">
        <h3>Assignment 9: Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>
            In this assignment, I implemented and analyzed a simple neural network from scratch to visualize its learned features, decision boundary, and gradients. 
            The Feedforward Neural Network consists of an input layer with dimensionality 2, one hidden layer with 3 neurons, and a single output layer for binary classification.
            I explored how the network learns a circular decision boundary for a synthetic 2D dataset, utilizing non-linear activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh), 
            cross-entropy loss, and gradient descent optimization. The project involved building the network from scratch, analyzing its behavior, and creating visualizations to show:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The distorted input space and decision hyperplane in the hidden layer.</li>
            <li>The decision boundary in the input space.</li>
            <li>The gradients, where edge thickness represents gradient magnitudes during training.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Additionally, I developed an interactive module using Flask, allowing users to train and visualize the network directly from a web interface. 
            The animations provide a dynamic representation of the learning process, including the convergence behavior for different activation functions.

        <h3>Assignment 10: Image Search</h3>
        <p>
            In this assignment, I implemented a simplified version of Google Image Search. The application allows users to input a text query, upload an image query, or combine both, using a weighted score to retrieve the top 5 most relevant images from the database with their similarity scores. Additional functionality includes the option to use embeddings from the first k principal components instead of CLIP embeddings for image queries. The GUI was built to offer an interactive experience, leveraging work from previous assignments and newly implemented techniques.

        <h3>Final Project: Fraud Detection Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            This final project involves developing a predictive model to identify potentially fraudulent transactions, focusing on binary classification. The task required applying various machine learning algorithms while adhering to the constraint of avoiding deep learning techniques. The final model was optimized for the F1-score to balance precision and recall, addressing the challenges of imbalanced data. The deliverables include a GitHub repository with reproducible code, a leaderboard submission, and a thorough analysis of the results.
